Support to automate Chipped

What does this mod do?
Chipped is a great mod that adds a variety of decorative blocks with beautiful and easy-to-use textures, but there is a problem when doing large scale building in Survival where you have to process the blocks by hand, 64 at a time.

This script supports automatic mass production of Chipped items.

This is a script file for KubeJS that allows the Stone Cutter to create items to be added to Chipped.
This script file can be used in conjunction with Create to automatically create Chipped items.

 It is intended for use with Forge.

 
Required Mods
Chipped 1.18.2 (chipped-forge-1.18.2-2.0.1.jar)
KubeJS 1.18.2 (kubejs-forge-1802.5.5-build.569.jar)
 
Optional Mods
Create 1.18.2 (create-1.18.2-0.5.1.c.jar)
 

We have confirmed that the above version works, but since it is a simple script, it should basically work with other versions as well.


How to install
\Instances\"folder"\kubejs\server_scripts\chipped.js
Please place the file so that it becomes ("folder" is an arbitrary Profile)


Problems
1. some workbenches will not need to be created because the Stone Cutter will be able to process all the items in Chipped.
2. the script was created for personal use, so there may still be problems.
